# 📊 Walmart Electronics Customer Review Sentiment Analysis

📝 **Description**

The **Walmart Electronics Customer Review Sentiment Analysis** project applies natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques to analyze customer sentiments from reviews of Walmart's electronic products. By categorizing reviews as positive, negative, or neutral, this project provides valuable insights into customer satisfaction and helps Walmart better understand user feedback for product improvements.

🔍 **Demonstration**

This analysis visualizes customer sentiment trends and categorizes individual reviews, enabling Walmart to track customer satisfaction over time and identify specific areas of improvement. Insights from this project can guide Walmart’s strategies in enhancing product offerings, addressing customer concerns, and boosting overall customer experience.

🛠️ **Technologies Used**

- **Python**
- **Pandas** (for data manipulation)
- **NumPy** (for numerical computations)
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** (for data visualization)
- **NLTK & Scikit-learn** (for NLP and model building)

📊 **Dataset**

The dataset consists of Walmart customer reviews for electronic products, labeled by sentiment. Each review provides insight into customers' satisfaction levels, helping the model classify feedback into categories:

- **Positive**: Reviews with positive feedback.
- **Negative**: Reviews expressing dissatisfaction.
- **Neutral**: Reviews that are mixed or ambiguous in sentiment.

**Note:** The dataset should be placed in the `data/` folder or another directory specified in the notebook.

🚀 **Future Scope**

This sentiment analysis project can be expanded in several ways:

- **Enhanced Text Preprocessing**: Experimenting with advanced text cleaning techniques or alternative vectorization methods for improved accuracy.
- **Integration with Real-Time Feedback**: Using this model to analyze real-time feedback data, enabling Walmart to respond quickly to customer sentiments.
- **Sentiment Prediction for New Products**: Adapting the model to predict sentiment trends for newly released electronics.
- **User Dashboard**: Creating an interactive dashboard to allow Walmart’s team to view sentiment trends over time.
